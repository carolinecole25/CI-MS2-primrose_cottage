### Design choices 
I designed this website using images taken of the town Primrose Cottage is location. I chose to use these images becuase I want the user to know straight away how idyllic the area is so they continue to scroll through the website.
I wanted the page to be easy to read, navigate and have a relaxed feel to it. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

### Fonts
I chose fjalla front with a back up of sans-serif because it is easy to read, simple and stylish. I liked the simplicity of it but the clarity with the bolder font, I thought it went well with the busy images on the page and the overall feel of the website.

### Colours
I chose to use an image as a background to my page which is bright with the colours of the sky, sea and harbour. I am pleased with the outcome of this because it looks effective and shows the users the location as soon as they enter the page.
I chose to use a slightly transparent white background to my navigation bar and the text box containing the introduction to each page. I chose this the colours wouldn't detract from the background image. 
I chose to use black font because I didn't want to destract from the image and I wanted the writing to be easy to read.

### Backgrounds 
I chose to use an image of Porthleven as a background to this website for the index page because that is the town the cottage is location; this suited the theme.
For the rest of the website, I felt the front image was a bit too busy. I changed it to be an image of the a beautiful beach and the sea which I personally took when visiting myself. I felt this was very fitting and only makes the website more appealing.

### Images 
* I used an image as the background for every page with the introduction placed on top of this. I chose to do this because I wanted the theme to be the same across the website and have a nice flow to it.
* I used images on the gallery page to show the cottage. These images were obtained [Above the Beach](https://www.abovebeachcottages.co.uk/cottage/prmros-primrose-cottage).
* I used google maps API for the map on the contact us page.

### Wireframes 
These wireframes were created using Blasmiq during the Scope Plane part of my design and planning process.

## Technologies Used 

* [Google API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-clustering#maps_marker_clustering-javascript) has been used for my find us page map.
* [Google Fonts](https://https://fonts.google.com/) has been used for my.
* [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) has been used for my social media links in my header and footer.
* [Hover.CSS](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) has been used for my menu bar hover.

## Testing

### HTML Validation
The [W3C Markup Validator Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. All errors were from bootstrap so all pages passed with 0 errors.
Click on the page to see the results: [Home](assets/testing/htmlhome.png) [Gallery](assets/testing/htmlgallery.png) [Explore](assets/testing/htmlexplore.png) [Contact](assets/testing/htmlcontact.png) [Quiz](assets/testing/htmlquiz.png) [Game](assets/testing/htmlgame.png) [End of Quiz](assets/testing/htmlend.png)

### CSS Validation
The [W3C Validator Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri) was used to validate the CSS of the website.
The CSS passed with no errors, click the links to see evidence: [Home](assets/testing/csshome.png) [Gallery](assets/testing/cssgallery.png) [Explore](assets/testing/cssexplore.png) [Contact](assets/testing/csscontact.png) [Quiz](assets/testing/cssquiz.png) [Game](assets/testing/cssgame.png) [End of Quiz](assets/testing/cssend.png)

### Accessibility 
[Wave WebAIM web accessibility valisation](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to ensure the website met a high level of accessibility and had no errors.
Click on the page name to see the result: [Home](assets/testing/wavehome.png) [Gallery](assets/testing/wavegallery.png) [Explore](assets/testing/waveexplore.png) [Contact](assets/testing/wavecontact.png) [Quiz](assets/testing/wavequiz.png) [Game](assets/testing/wavegame.png) [End of Quiz](assets/testing/waveend.png)
As you can see there was 1 error on the explore and contact page, this is due to an error on the google API code, not my code. Therefore all pages passed with zero errors.

### Performance 
[Google lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website. Click on the pages to see the results:
[Home](assets/testing/lhhome.png) [Gallery](assets/testing/lhgallery.png) [Explore](assets/testing/lhexplore.png) [Contact](assets/testing/lhcontact.png) [Quiz](assets/testing/lhquiz.png) [Game](assets/testing/lhgame.png) [End of Quiz](assets/testing/lhend.png)
The performance of my website is something I would work on in future, some pages I am happy with but other's containing images, lots are javascript and google API's I would work on improving in the future.

### Javascript
[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used to test the Javascript code. All pages passed with zerp errors, click on the pages to see the result:

## Bugs

* The background image was not displaying on my index.html page, I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp) and tutor support to help by changing the link to my image and adding `z-index: 1000;` and it worked. 
* I solved the carousel problems I was having my using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/). This worked perfectly and I really happy with the results.
* The gallery page carousel bootstap was not centrallising, so I added it into a container. This worked really well and I am happy with the results.
* I added an image to all my pages and when I added these images I used ``height: 100vh`` in my CSS but when I added anything below this it caused a huge gap in my code. I spoke to tutor support reagrding this issue and we came to the conclusion that we needed to change it to ``height: calc(100vh - 248px)``
* I tried doing the carousel on the gallery page using javascript, HTML and CSS with help of this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBzsE0oieio) video. This was not a productive use of my time and as you can see from [this image](/workspace/CI-MS2-primrose_cottage/assets/testing/carousel-js.png), it did not work well and was not responsive. The below js code is what I was using:
* The google maps API in the expore and contact page would dissapear from the page and you would need to refresh for it reappear. I spoke to tutor support and found an issue online stating the map script tag needs to be higher up on the page. I changed the order of this and it now works.

<code> const track = document.querySelector('.slideshow-track');
const slides = Array.from(track.children);
const nextButton = document.querySelector('.slideshow-button--right');
const prevButton = document.querySelector('.slideshow_button--left');
const dotsNav = document.querySelector('.slideshow-nav');
const dots = Array.from(dotsNav.children);

const slideWidth = slides[0].getBoundingClientRect().width;

// arrange the slides next to each other 

const setSlidePosition = (slide, index) => {
    slide.style.left = slideWidth * index + 'px';
}
slides.forEach(setSlidePosition);

const moveToSlide = (track, currentSlide, targetSlide) => {
    track.style.transform = 'translateX(-' + targetSlide.style.left + ')';
    currentSlide.classList.remove('current-slide');
    targetSlide.classList.add('current-slide');
}

// when cliked right, move slides to the right 
nextButton.addEventListener('click', e => {
    const currentSlide = track.querySelector('.current-slide');
    const nextSlide = currentSlide.nextElementSibling;
    
    moveToSlide(track, currentSlide, nextSlide);
}); </code>

* When I scrolled to the top of my page, the scrolling nav dissapearred, as you can see from [this image](/workspace/CI-MS2-primrose_cottage/assets/testing/scrolling-nav.png). I realised I did not need to use Javascript for the scrolling nav bar (code added below), so I removed this and it worked well.
<code>`` window.addEventListener("scroll", function(){
    var header = document.querySelector("header");
    header.classList.toggle("scroll", window.scrollY > 0);
}); </code>

* I added some Javascript to the contact form, but it was not popping up or performing as it should do. After speaking to tutor support, it was because there was a doct in the wrong place on the ``var = document.getElementById() `` part of my code.
* The maps on the Explore and Gallery page would sometimes appear but sometimes not, having to reload the page to make them reappear. I used [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41065766/initmap-is-not-a-function-google-maps-javascript) to help with this issue and it seems to have worked.
