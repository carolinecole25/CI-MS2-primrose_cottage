* Relavant information regarding the cottage, it's location and leaves the users happy with the information provided.
* A functioning contact us page so if the users does have any questions they can get in touch.
* Visual icones and images that suit the theme of the website.


### Design choices 
I designed this website using images taken of the town Primrose Cottage is location. I chose to use these images becuase I want the user to know straight away how idyllic the area is so they continue to scroll through the website.
I wanted the page to be easy to read, navigate and have a relaxed feel to it. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

### Fonts
I chose ...... front because it is easy to read, simple and stylish. 

### Icons
I used arrows from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the gallery page to make it easy to navigate.

### Colours
I chose to use an image as a background to my page which is bright with the colours of the sky, sea and harbour. I am pleased with the outcome of this because it looks effective and shows the users the location as soon as they enter the page.
I chose to use a slightly transparent white background to my navigation bar and the text box containing the introduction to each page. I chose this the colours wouldn't detract from the background image. 
I chose to use black font because I didn't want to destract from the image and I wanted the writing to be easy to read.


### Backgrounds 
I chose to use an image of Porthleven as a background to this website because that is the town the cottage is location; this suited the theme.


### Images 
* I used an image as the background for every page with the introduction placed on top of this. I chose to do this because I wanted the theme to be the same across the website and have a nice flow to it.
* I used images on the gallery page to show the cottage.
* I used google maps API for the map on the contact us page.
